#This is the default Pentoo make.conf file, it controls many basic system settings.
#You can find information on how to edit this file in "man make.conf" as well as
#on the web at https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/etc/portage/make.conf

#Please adjust your CFLAGS as desired, information can be found here: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/CFLAGS
#Do not modify these FLAGS unless you know what you are doing, always check the defaults first with "portageq envvar CFLAGS"
#This is the default for pentoo at the time of build:
#CFLAGS="-Os -mtune=core2 -pipe -frecord-gcc-switches"
#A safe choice would be to keep whatever Pentoo defaults are, but optimize for your specific machine:
#CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -march=native"
#If you do change your CFLAGS, it is best for all the compile flags to match so uncomment the following three lines:
CHOST="x86_64-pc-linux-gnu"
CFLAGS="-march=skylake -O2 -pipe"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

#Please adjust your use flags, if you don't use gpu cracking, it is probably safe to remove opencl
#Currently opencl is only supported on nvidia gpu, so if you drop nvidia from VIDEO_CARDS, drop opencl
USE="${USE} opencl vulkan ibus vnc wayland eglfs webp audit libssh dtrace firewalld xen sasl virtualbox wireshark-plugins"

#MAKEOPTS is set automatically by the profile to jobs equal to processors, you do not need to set it.

#Default VIDEO_CARDS setting enables nearly everything, you can enable fewer here if you like:
#VIDEO_CARDS="nvidia nouveau amdgpu radeon"
#Intel gpu should use modesetting driver which isn't optional but the recommended setting is: VIDEO_CARDS="intel i965"
#you can check available options with "emerge -vp xorg-drivers"

# EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS is set automatically by livecd-tools autoconfig during first live boot.
# This should be equal to number of processors, see "man emerge" for details.
EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS="${EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS} --jobs=12 --load-average=12"
