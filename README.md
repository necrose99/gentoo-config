My /etc/portage

(https://github.com/necrose99/arm64-portage)

Trying to eventually unify my configs. 

Oleh's template has shown me a path ..

Currently my arm64 or Ryzen make.conf is wired for everything.. 

And makes for possible snafus more likely.. 

His general make.conf and hardware types makes for more dynamically 
Fixed cpu flags/automatically detected etc..
