Trying to eventually unify my configs.  make a gentoo makefile with more swapable sub items items ie CCFLAGS keywords etc...
and easier to READ. 

Oleh's template has shown me a path ..  towards makeing a more portable gentoo config between devices... 

Currently my arm64 or Ryzen make.conf  skylake laptop , is wired for everything.. 

And makes for possible snafus more likely.. 

His general make.conf and hardware types makes for more dynamically 
Fixed cpu flags/automatically detected etc..  would be a godsend.
